## Red Team Rules of Engagement (ROE)

<p>Rules of Engagement (RoE) are a legally binding outline of the client objectives and scope with further details of engagement expectations between both parties. This is the first "official" document in the engagement planning process and requires proper authorization between the client and the red team.</p>

<p>The format and wording of the RoE are critical since it is a legally binding contract and sets clear expectations.</p>
