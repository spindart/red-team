## Campaign plaining

<p>Prior to this task, we have primarily focused on engagement planning and documentation from the business perspective. Campaign planning uses the information acquired and planned from the client objectives and RoE and applies it to various plans and documents to identify how and what the red team will do.</p><p>
</p><p>Each internal red team will have its methodology and documentation for campaign planning. We will be showing one in-depth set of plans that allows for precise communication and detailed documentation. The campaign summary we will be using consists of four different plans varying in-depth and coverage adapted from military operations documents. Each plan can be found in the table below with a brief explanation.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Type of Plan</b></td><td><b>Explanation of Plan</b></td><td><b>Plan Contents</b></td></tr><tr><td>Engagement Plan</td><td>An overarching description of technical requirements of the red team.<br></td><td>CONOPS, Resource and Personnel Requirements, Timelines<br></td></tr><tr><td>Operations Plan</td><td>An expansion of the <span style="font-weight:600" >Engagement Plan</span>. Goes further into specifics of each detail.<br></td><td>Operators, Known Information, Responsibilities, etc.<br></td></tr><tr><td>Mission Plan</td><td>The exact commands to run and execution time of the engagement.<br></td><td>Commands to run, Time Objectives, Responsible Operator, etc.<br></td></tr><tr><td>Remediation Plan</td><td>Defines how the engagement will proceed after the campaign is finished.<br></td><td>Report, Remediation consultation, etc.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Another example of a campaign plan is the&nbsp;<a href="http://redteam.guide/">redteam.guide</a>&nbsp;engagement checklist. </p><p>
</p><p>In the upcoming tasks, we will go further in-depth with these plans, documentation, and specifics of each as we take a deep dive into campaign planning.</p><ul>
