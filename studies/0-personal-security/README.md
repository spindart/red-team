# Strong passwords & Password managers

### Never use the same password for different websites and apps, use one password for each
### Don't use passwords with commons words and variants.
### Use passwords as long as allowed for the registration/update password form
### Prefer to save and generate your passwords by software that generate strong passwords for all your records.


* [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
* [1password](https://1password.com/pt)
* [lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/pt)
* [nordpass](https://nordpass.com/) $$$


### Change all your passwords right now and use one of these tools to save them

<b>These apps will generate strong passwords (try to understand how many characters is possible in the website/app form and generate passwords and save them in these apps)</b>

you just need to remember the master password for these apps, use a long phrase of at least 20 characters for these apps
for example:

"thetripthatIlikedthemostwenttochina#@!"

<b style="color:red;">Remember, the only password you can't forget is your master key, and your master key needs to be a long sentence that you preferably never forget.</b>


# 2FA (Two-factor authentication)

<b style="color:red">Use 2FA wherever possible</b>

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an identity and access management security method that requires two forms of identification to access resources and data. 2FA gives businesses the ability to monitor and help protect their most vulnerable information and networks. some of the previous apps like bitwarden already have 2fa.

### Advantages of 2FA

- Businesses use 2FA to help protect their employees' personal and business assets. This is important because it prevents cybercriminals from stealing, destroying or accessing your internal data records for their own benefit.
 

- The advantages of 2FA are endless. For example, with 2FA, there is no need for users to upload or download a token generator, or an application associated with one. Most websites use your mobile device to text, call or use a 2FA customized for your business to verify your identity.
 

- Some other advantages of 2FA include:

• No need to use a hardware token generator. These types of 2FA methods are often lost or misplaced. However, with advanced technology, 2FA methods are more convenient than ever.

• Password generators are more efficient than traditional passwords. Generators are the most secure option as no two passwords are the same.

• Maximum password entry prevents cybercriminals from breaking in and accessing sensitive data.

• The process is manageable and easy to use.
